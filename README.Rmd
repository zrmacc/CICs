# Description

This package provides functions for inference on the difference in event rates, quantiles, and areas under the cumulative incidence curves between two treatment arms. 

# Installation

```{R, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo = 'zrmacc/CICs')
```

# Examples

Synthetic example data in the format expected by this package may be loaded via:

```{R}
library(CICs)
data(cic_data)
head(cic_data)
```

In these data, `arm` is the treatment arm, 0 for reference, 1 for treatment; `time` is the observation time in days; and `status` is the event type, 0 for censoring, 1 for recovery, 2 for death. For analysing other data sets, `arm` should likewise be coded 0/1, and the event with status 1 is assumed to be the event of interest. 

## Compare Event Rates

To find a confidence interval and p-vaue for the difference and ratio in event rates at $\tau = 28$ days:
```{R}
event_rates <- CompareEventRates(
  time = cic_data$time,
  status = cic_data$status,
  arm = cic_data$arm,
  tau = 28,
  reps = 2000,
  alpha = 0.05
)
show(event_rates)
```

## Compare Medians

To find a confidence interval and p-vaue for the difference and ratio in medians $q = 0.5$:
```{R}
medians <- CompareQuants(
  time = cic_data$time,
  status = cic_data$status,
  arm = cic_data$arm,
  q = 0.5,
  reps = 2000,
  alpha = 0.05
)
show(medians)
```

## Copare AUCs

To find a confidence interval and p-vaue for the difference and ratio in areas under the curve at $\tau = 28$ days:
```{R}
aucs <- CompareAUCs(
  time = cic_data$time,
  status = cic_data$status,
  arm = cic_data$arm,
  tau = 28,
  reps = 2000,
  alpha = 0.05
)
show(aucs)
```

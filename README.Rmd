# Inference for Cumulative Incidence Curves

Zachary McCaw <br>
Updated: 20-10-27

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

### Description

This package provides functions for inference on the difference in AUCs, event rates, and quantiles comparing two cumulative incidence curves. Also see [MCC](https://github.com/zrmacc/MCC) for inference on mean cumulative count curves. 

## Installation

```{R, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo = 'zrmacc/CICs')
```

## Examples

### Data

Synthetic example data in the format expected by this package may be loaded via:

```{R}
library(CICs)
data(cic_data)
head(cic_data)
```

In these data, `arm` is the treatment arm, 0 for reference, 1 for treatment; `time` is the observation time in days; and `status` is the event type, 0 for censoring, 1 for recovery, 2 for death. For analysing other data sets, `arm` should likewise be coded 0/1, and the event with status 1 is assumed to be the event of interest. 

### Compare AUCs

To find a confidence interval and p-vaue for the difference and ratio in areas under the curve at $\tau = 28$ days:
```{R}
aucs <- CompareCICs(
  time = cic_data$time,
  status = cic_data$status,
  arm = cic_data$arm,
  sum_stat = 'AUC',
  param = 28,
  reps = 100,
  alpha = 0.05
)
show(aucs)
```

### Compare Event Rates

To find a confidence interval and p-vaue for the difference and ratio in event rates at $\tau = 28$ days:
```{R}
rates <- CompareCICs(
  time = cic_data$time,
  status = cic_data$status,
  arm = cic_data$arm,
  sum_stat = 'Rate',
  param = 28,
  reps = 100,
  alpha = 0.05
)
show(rates)
```

### Compare Medians

To find a confidence interval and p-vaue for the difference and ratio in medians $q = 0.5$:
```{R}
quants <- CompareCICs(
  time = cic_data$time,
  status = cic_data$status,
  arm = cic_data$arm,
  sum_stat = 'Quantile',
  param = 0.5,
  reps = 100,
  alpha = 0.05
)
show(quants)
```
